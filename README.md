# COE 379L Project 01 — Austin Animal Center Outcomes

## Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for Project 01 in COE 379L: Software Design for Responsible Intelligent Systems. The assignment focuses on exploring the Austin Animal Center dataset and building classification models to predict `OutcomeType`.

## Repository Structure

- `data/raw/` — original dataset(s) provided by the course staff
- `data/processed/` — cleaned and engineered datasets derived from the raw data
- `notebooks/project01.ipynb` — main Jupyter notebook covering Parts 1 and 2
- `reports/` — written report(s) for Part 3 and any supplementary figures
- `docs/use_of_ai.md` — log documenting any AI-assisted code generation per course policy
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used in the notebook environment

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (conda, venv, etc.).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the Austin Animal Center dataset into `data/raw/`.
4. Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and open `notebooks/project01.ipynb`.

## Course Policy Reminders

- Update `docs/use_of_ai.md` whenever you incorporate AI-generated code. Reference the corresponding entry inside the notebook with a comment (e.g., `# See Use of AI log [1]`).
- Keep the repository accessible to the instructors listed in the project description when submitting.
